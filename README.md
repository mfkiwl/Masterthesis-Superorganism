Significant advancements in decentralized storage and computation
technologies, decentralized consensus-based distributed ledger
technologies and artificial intelligence have created new but largely
unexplored possibilities. This work evaluates how those technologies
can be combined to create a decentralized platform, that is completely
controlled by the community and whose purpose is solely defined by the
community. The system permits the bundling of power in form of
central authorities and equally spreads the power over the community,
the only requirement for participation being the possession of a
computer with a webcam. In addition, financial wealth must not lead
to an higher impact. When launched, the systems purpose is not
defined. The default features of the system evolve during time
depending on the ideas of the community and truly democratic
processes. The system is able to reward users for participation with an
intrinsic cryptographic currency. This should encourage the users to
share ideas and concerns and in addition enables the possibility to
spawn projects, which are realized and operated by the community,
whereupon the participants are rewarded by the system. Whatever is
decided by the community and created within the system, is paid by
the system and owned by everybody, it becomes a common good.
Hence, the community shapes the system and defines its purpose so
that it serves the community according to their needs.
